# Demo app to start testing

The live app is [here](https://reliable-trifle-855414.netlify.app/).

It is a simple form. There are no right and wrong answers.


## Systems Testing at [NCH](https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/): Introduction to manual and automated testing.

### The task:

1. Test the form using manual testing. To do so please **make a copy** of the test log [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12qnD9U7rQKxIK5UhhZpKYJ9FjIV1dnBg/edit#gid=1510390888).
2. Either re-run tests on remote or clone and run tests locally. Have a look inside test files.
3. **That is all!**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run project locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EDGENortheastern/systems-testing-demo-app.git
```

Install modules needed for running tests locally.

```bash
npm install
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
