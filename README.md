# Demo app to start testing

The live app is [here](https://reliable-trifle-855414.netlify.app/).

It is a simple form. There are no right and wrong answers.


## Systems Testing at [NCH](https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/): Introduction to manual and automated testing.

### The task:

1. Test the form using manual testing. To do so please **make a copy** of the test log [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12qnD9U7rQKxIK5UhhZpKYJ9FjIV1dnBg/edit#gid=1510390888).
2. Either re-run tests on remote or clone and run tests locally. Have a look inside test files.
3. **That is all!**
